## About Me

I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where I also serve as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Mathematics.Under the guidance of Dr. Arshia Khan, who leads research in robotics and sensing technologies for human-centered care, I am beginning my graduate studies with a strong interest in applying machine learning and deep learning to healthcare challenges.

I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), Bangladesh. My research experience spans disease detection (breast cancer, COVID-19) and DNA post-translational modifications.
